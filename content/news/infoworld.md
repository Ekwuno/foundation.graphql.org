The Linux Foundation plans to host a foundation to support the GraphQL API project, with the intent of growing a neutral ecosystem for the technology.

GraphQL is a specification for building APIs. It is intended to make cross-platform and mobile development simpler. Providing an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers use a strongly typed query language to define requests and responses, letting an application specify what it needs from an API. GraphQL enables access to multiple data sources through a single request.
