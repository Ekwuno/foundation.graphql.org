The GraphQL Foundation plans to host the [GraphQL specification](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/), [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation, [DataLoader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) library, and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) developer tool. These projects will continue to be available at https://github.com/graphql.

The GraphQL Specification project is a collaborative effort with the GraphQL Foundation, the Linux Foundation and the Joint Development Foundation, which provides open source projects with a swift path to standardization for open specifications. Developers will have an open GraphQL specification and open source software implementations available for designing conformant APIs.
